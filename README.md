# ABBYY Compreno Semantic Hierarchy (simplified)


The semantic hierarchy is organized in the form of the tree, which consists of the semantic classes (SCs) printed in capitals - the SCs are universal for all languages included in the hierarchy and denote semantic senses common for all languages.  
Each SC contains lexical classes (LCs) - lexicon of different languages. LCs are written in small letters, for instance:

One SC can include LCs with different semantics - antonyms, for instance (as ‘быстрый - quick’ vs ‘медленный - slow’ above). In this case, their meanings are differentiated through semantic attributes - semantemes, attached to the necessary classes in the SH.

LCs, in turn, can contain semantic derivates (SD), which are usually formed from the lexical class and differ from it through some meaning components, like ‘плыть - swim’ -> ‘уплыть - swim away, приплыть - swim up’, and so on. The SDs are written in italic. 

The SCs can also include terms - set phrases with some definite sense, located in the hierarchy according to the general meaning of the whole collocation. The terms are written with small letters in square brackets:

In the hierarchy, we can see both the closest SC-parent of the lexical class and its closest hyperonym class, which is shown as its parent in the generalized semantic markup. The hyperonym SCs are printed with bold letters in the tree.

Here, we have presented a shortened version of the hierarchy: one can see only the hyperonym SCs, which are shown in the generalized version of the semantic markup:
